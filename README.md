# Pong Game

This is a simple Pong game implemented using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game features two paddles, a ball, and basic collision detection to simulate a classic Pong game experience.

## Features

- **Two Player Controls**: One paddle controlled with the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys, and the other paddle controlled with the `W` and `S` keys.
- **Ball Movement**: The ball moves and bounces off the paddles and walls, with its movement reversing upon collision.
- **Random Points**: The game uses a randomized points system each time the ball interacts with a paddle or goes out of bounds.
